# XT Tailwind for Joomla

To get started, clone the project and install the dependencies:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install
```

After that, start up Webpack Development Server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The page is rendered here <http://localhost:8080/>.

Webpack Development Server will watch `/src/styles.css` and `/tailwind.js` and rebuild your stylesheet on every change. You can play around with `/src/index.html` to see the effects of your changes.

The sample page renders [my blog](https://blog.anibalhsanchez.com) layout redesigned with Tailwind ;-)

To build a production bundle run:

```bash
npm run prod
```

After that you will have a ready to deploy bundle at `/dist`
